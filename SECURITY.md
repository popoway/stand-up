## Reporting a Vulnerability

- The specific product and software version(s) which you believe are affected
- A description of the behavior you observed as well as the behavior that you expected
- A numbered list of steps required to reproduce the issue and a video demonstration, if the steps may be hard to follow

You'll receive an automatic reply which acknowledges that we received your report, and weâ€™ll contact you if we need more information.
